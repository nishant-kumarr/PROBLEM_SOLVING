/*

Hey visitor ! This is my code that facilitates a program that is explained below : 

Program requirement : You are given with array of n distinct intergers along with size and another integer X. 
Write a program to find whether there exist two integers whose sum is X or not, with best effective time complexity 
preferrably O(n-logn). 

[Hint: Use merge sort.] --- Concept at the bottom.

    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
    
    while (i < leftSize && j < rightSize) {
        if (left[i] <= right[j])
            arr[k++] = left[i++];
        else

CONCEPT : 

1. Take the array size, array data and Sum that to be searched.
2. Perform merge sort.
3. Check for Pairs (two numbers only) as stated below : 
    i) Take two variable 'low' at starting of array & another 'high' at end.
    ii) Iterate the while loop until low < high.
    iii) Inside that while loop if arr[low] + arr[high] equals sum, print it and stop.
    iv) else if arr[low] + arr[high] is greater than sum, since array is sorted so, decrease the 'high' to try with a lower value.
    v) else, definetley the arr[low] + arr[high] is lower, so, increase the 'low' to try with higher value, as the array is sorted.
4. Now, if the while loop iterated and didn't found any pair. So, write a statement here to print "Pair not found".
5. That's it.
